    <h5>
        Purpose of the Study
    </h5>
    <ul>
        <p>This study's primary goal is to understand how data visualization can help software testers,
            and developers to detect data-related bugs faster and easier.
            The output of some data-driven software contain large amount of data, and this output should be tested after
            each release to make sure that the new changes have not introduced new bugs
            (in this case, unexpected change of output data).
        </p>
        <p>
            In this experiment, we will work on the output of the <b>Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM)</b>
            application.
            This application takes observations data collected from field,
            applies some hydrological models on them, and plots the output in form of line charts.
            Testing output of this application after each release is challenging and testers can easily fail to detect new bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have introduced a tool that visualizes data in the form of data tables and line charts.
            Our purpose is to compare the usability of this tool with previous way of testing the output.
            This experiment has two tasks and will take about 30 minutes to finish.
        </p>

            in a secure server hosted by University of Saskatchewan. Thus, the identity of the participant will remain unknown. Only the
            researchers will have access to the ID and the information collected in the study.
