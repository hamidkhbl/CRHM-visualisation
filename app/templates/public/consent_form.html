    <h5>
        Purpose of the Study
    </h5>
    <p>This study's primary goal is to understand how data visualization can help software testers,
        and developers detect data-related bugs faster and easier.
        The output of some data-driven software is a large amount of data, and this output should be tested after
        each release to make sure that the new changes have not introduced new bugs
        (in this case, unexpected change of output data).
    </p>
    <p>
        In this experiment, we will work on the output of the <b>Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM)</b> application.
        This application takes observations data collected from the field,
        applies some hydrological models, and plots the output in the form of line charts.
        The testing output of this application after each release is challenging and can lead to generation software bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
        We have introduced a tool that visualizes data in the form of data tables and line charts.
        Our purpose is to compare the usability of this tool with previous ways of testing the output.
        This experiment has six steps and will take about 30 minutes to finish.
